      <p>I’m Ramisha Malik, a second year student at Baruch College, majoring in Computer Information Systems with concentration in Information Risk Management and Cybersecurity. I’m a tutor at a NYC high school called ReStart Academy. In my free time, I like to play badminton and basketball. </p>
      <p>I am very passionate about providing solutions to environmental issues, particularly global warming and climate change. The Australian fires, earthquakes in Guayanilla, and Puerto Rico, the increase in sea pollution, as well as the drastic weather changes in many parts of the world, are evidence that more attention should be brought to environmental issues. In summer 2019, I participated in the WiTNY program, where I learned coding and website design. With this new knowledge, I created a website about global warming and climate change, which provides information and statistics from all around the world. It also informs the viewers of how to make a change, for example, by using recycling machines near them. I believe the internet has a great power that influences us today, and while pursuing my undergraduate degree, I want to create a mobile shopping app where the users can buy recycled clothes, shoes, and accessories. This preventive measure will allow users to save more money while saving the planet.</p>
